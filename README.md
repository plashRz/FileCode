# FileCode

this code performs basic file operaions like
a)read
b)write(also append/modify)
c)create

Java File class, fileReader and fileWriter use is demonstrated.
We can input file name what we want to create.
If the file is new file writeSomething() will add fresh content to file, but if the file already has content it will add the new content at the end of file.
